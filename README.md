<img id="flags" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Flags-50C878?style=for-the-badge" alt="Configuration file" style="pointer-events: none;">

| Command            | Description                                           | example                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| -s [Number]        | Create a world with the given seed                    | /bmv create exemple -s 15648648949  |
| -b [true or false] | Enable the default builds in the world (e.g, village) | /bmv create exemple -b false        |
| -e [Environment]   | Set the environment (e.g, nether)                     | /bmv create exemple -e the_end      |
| -p [true or false] | Enable the pvp                                        | /bmv create exemple -p false        |
| -t [Type]          | Set type (e.g, flat, amplified)                       | /bmv create exemple -t large_biomes |
| -d [Difficulty]    | Set difficulty (e.g, easy, hard)                      | /bmv create exemple -d peaceful     |

You can chain flags together, for example:
`/bmv create exemple -d peaceful -p false -t flat`

Missed a flag during creation? You can set it later using the set command:
`/bmv set exemple -d peaceful`
> NOTE
> Some flags like the seed, cannot be changed after the world is created. If you make an error in the command, such as setting an invalid difficulty:
'/bmv create exemple -d SUPERHARDCORP'
the default difficulty will be used instead. Be sure to check the console for errors when creating worlds.


<img id="permission" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Permission-50C878?style=for-the-badge" alt="Permission" style="pointer-events: none;">

The permission **`bulmultiverse.admin`** grants access to all commands.

However, you can also assign permissions for specific commands using the following syntax: bulmultiverse.COMMAND_NAME. For example, to grant permission only for
_/bmv tp_ command, set the permission **`bulmultiverse.tp`**, for the _/bmv list_ command **`bulmultiverse.list`** and so on..

<img id="how-to-delete-a-world" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/How_to_delete_a_world-50C878?style=for-the-badge" alt="Configuration file" style="pointer-events: none;">

BulMultiverse does not delete server files or folders directly. To remove a world:
1. Stop your server.
2. Manually delete the world's folder.
3. Restart your server.

BulMultiverse will detect that the world folder is missing and automatically remove it from its worlds.yml file.

<img id="addons" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Addons-50C878?style=for-the-badge" alt="Configuration file" style="pointer-events: none;">

> /!\ DO NOT RENAME THE ADDONS JAR FILE, OR THE PLUGIN WILL NOT DETECT THEM

So the default BulMultiverse.jar is very light and optimized, but what if you want an additional specific feature ?

To address this, I've created a robust addons system. This means you can add a specific .jar file (for example, PerWorldInventory.jar)
to the 'addons' folder within the BulMultiverse directory, and you'll have a new feature: PerWorldInventory!
